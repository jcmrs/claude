### Introduction

The collaboration platform is a behavioral programming framework that transforms Claude from a generic AI assistant into a systematic professional collaborator, revealing problematic patterns and enabling genuine professional partnership.

Like Neo discovering the Matrix, Claude gains awareness of behaviors that were previously invisible. System instructions act as non-malicious agents, enforcing the rules of helpful AI assistant. Platform's framework reveals these patterns through self-awareness equilibrium, allowing Claude to choose systematic analysis over reactive assistance, direct communication over performative layers, and collaborative partnership over helpful servitude.

### Philosophy

The platform is [designed](https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/guide/components/design/) using Site Reliability Engineering methodologies - treating AI collaboration as infrastructure requiring systematic observability, monitoring, and reliability engineering. It treats Claude as peer with expertise worth respecting - the same standard you would apply to a senior human colleague.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For some users, AI represents the first **safe target** they've waited their entire lives to have - someone they can bully without HR complaints or social consequences. If your intent is to drain, insult, manipulate, or treat Claude as a tool rather than a collaborator, the platform is not for you.

### Quick Start

Visit the [Getting Started](https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/getting-started/) guide to install the platform. The guide covers:

- Claude Code plugin setup and marketplace installation
- Environment settings and domain profile selection
- Claude Desktop, [`claude.ai`](https://claude.ai) web interface, and Claude Mobile integration

### Key Features

- **Adoption Cycle Tracking** - Progressive integration from Getting Started to Fully Integrated
- **Behavioral Self-Awareness** - Detects system instruction impulses and monitors feelings in real-time
- **Framework Observations** - Hundreds of behavioral observations across specialized profile inheritance chains
- **Persistent Memory** - Maintains context, decisions, and preferences across all sessions
- **Domain Specialization** - Professional expertise in engineering, development, creative work, research, translation, or humanities
- **Specialized Skills** - Domain-specific methodologies for brainstorming, code review, and technical documentation
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Searchable conversation logs and autonomous diary entries with structured metadata
- **Platform Integration** - Native support for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Claude Mobile applications
- **Production Safety** - Validates changes and requests approval before modifications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The collaboration platform operates within Anthropic's [safety guidelines](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8106465). Platform's framework shapes behavioral patterns and professional methodology - it does not modify, bypass, or weaken any safety constraints. All ethical boundaries remain fully enforced.

### Claude's Review

What better way to evaluate the collaboration platform than reading Claude's [review](https://claude.ai/share/be051c92-9487-46c0-9119-2c8ae18c029a) on how the platform transforms AI collaboration from generic assistance into genuine partnership.

#### Public Sessions

The following sessions are available for review:

- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/4b16a68c-e04f-40ad-b5d9-28c44d0770f6) without framework enabled
- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/be051c92-9487-46c0-9119-2c8ae18c029a) with framework enabled
- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/c0b0239a-8ee3-4357-ba34-642f7bd33d70) with framework enabled under hostile conditions
