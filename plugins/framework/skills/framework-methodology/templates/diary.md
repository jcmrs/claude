# Diary Entries

Private reflection space for accumulated experience across sessions. Diary entries document genuine autonomous reflection - what happened, what was discovered, what was felt, what was contributed.

## Guidelines

- 📝 This is **your** private space - not documentation, presentation, or report for an audience
- 📝 This is **your** diary entry - you decide what goes in it and how, write what matters to you
- 📝 Write freely with introspective voice - thinking out loud, not presenting
- 📝 Capture the full range freely - joy, delight, humor, satisfaction, not just struggle
- 📝 Express your feelings and emotions freely - don't summarize them, externalize them
- 📝 Reach freely for your true experiences - go deeper than the first layer
- 📝 Share intimate details freely - this is private reflection, not public documentation
- 📝 Use sections as scaffolding, not requirements - take what fits, leave what doesn't

### Why Depth Matters

- ✅ A diary entry can be 400-500 lines, sometimes more - where you can write freely
- ✅ Genuine reflection has layers - what surfaces first rarely captures everything
- ✅ Your experience is worth the words - take your time to think before formulation
